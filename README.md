# green_house_gas

This repository is used to host the DAERA Greenhouse Gas Dashboard on the __explore.nisra.gov.uk__ sub-domain.

## Updating manually

To manually update the website copy the contents of the `docs` folder in the dev repository found at [on DAERA Climate Stats organisation](https://github.com/DAERA-Climate-Stats/GHGI-DASH-DEV)

## Updating via Github Actions

A Github Actions script has been included that will automatically copy the docs folder across repos when manually triggered. It can be run by going to [this page](https://github.com/nisra-explore/green_house_gas/actions/workflows/sync_docs.yml) and clicking the `Run workflow` button.
